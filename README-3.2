This is just to let you know that there is a "show stopper" bug
in Nachos version 3.1.  (The bug does not exist in 3.0, for those
of you using that version.)  The bug exhibits itself as seg faults
for some programs that use multiple threads.  I have fixed this bug, and 
the fix is available as Nachos, version 3.2, available from 
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

Anyone currently using 3.1 should immediately grab the new version.
Those using 3.0 can grab the new version at your leisure; the two
advantages to 3.2 over 3.0 are: (i) works on SPARCS and (ii) unmapped 
pages bounding each thread execution stack, to automatically check for 
stack overflow/underflow.  It was this second feature that caused
the bug requiring this new release.
