1.) CHANGES TO NACHOS FOR COMPILATION ON SPARC/SOLARIS 2.3

1.1) code/Makefile.dep: Added two definitions for new host (HOST_SVR4 for
      all hosts of this class, HOST_SunOS5 for changes specific to
      SunOS 5/Solaris)

	$ diff code/Makefile.dep ORIG

	11c11
	< # HOST = -DHOST_MIPS
	---
	> HOST = -DHOST_MIPS
	15,20d14
	< 
	< # SUN SPARC, Sun 5.x
	< HOST = -DHOST_SPARC -DHOST_IS_BIG_ENDIAN -DHOST_SVR4 -DHOST_SunOS5
	< CPP = /usr/ccs/lib/cpp
	< CPP_AS_FLAGS = -D_ASM
	< LDFLAGS = -lsocket -lnsl


1.2) code/Makefile.common: Need to assemble switch.s with new flag

	$ diff Makefile.common ORIG

	128c128
	<       $(CPP) $(CPP_AS_FLAGS) -P $(INCPATH) $(HOST) ../threads/switch.s > swtch.s
	---
	>       $(CPP) -P $(INCPATH) $(HOST) ../threads/switch.s > swtch.s


1.3) code/bin/Makefile: Sparc is big endian -- do the changes mentioned
      in the comment

	$ diff code/bin/Makefile ORIG

	17c17
	< #CFLAGS=-I./ -I../threads
	---
	> CFLAGS=-I./ -I../threads
	20,24c20
	< #all: coff2noff disassemble 
	< 
	< CFLAGS= -I./ -I../threads -DHOST_IS_BIG_ENDIAN
	< all: coff2noff
	< 
	---
	> all: coff2noff disassemble 


1.4) code/machine/sysdep.cc: Some changes needed to include appropriate
      files and passing correct parameter types to system calls

	$ diff sysdep.cc ORIG

	44,46c44
	< #ifdef        HOST_SVR4
	< #include      <fcntl.h>
	< #endif
	---
	> 
	50c48
	< #if   defined(HOST_SNAKE) || defined(HOST_SVR4)
	---
	> #ifdef HOST_SNAKE

	87d83
	< #endif
	124c120
	< #if   defined(HOST_i386) || defined(HOST_SVR4)
	---
	> #ifdef HOST_i386
	375,380c371
	< #ifdef        HOST_SVR4
	<                   (sockaddr *) &uName, 
	< #else
	<                   (char *) &uName, 
	< #endif        /* HOST_SVR4 */
	<                   sizeof(uName));
	---
	>                         (char *) &uName, sizeof(uName));


1.5) code/threads/switch.s: Set correct paths for includes and changed
      appearance of .globl definitions

	$ diff code/threads/switch.s ORIG

	117,120d116
	< #ifdef        HOST_SunOS5
	< #include      <sys/trap.h>
	< #include      <sys/asm_linkage.h>
	< #else
	123,124d118
	< #endif        /* HOST_SUNOS5 */
	< 
	135,138d128
	< #ifdef        HOST_SunOS5
	< .globl        ThreadRoot
	< ThreadRoot:
	< #else
	141d130
	< #endif
	168,171d156
	< #ifdef        HOST_SunOS5
	< .globl        SWITCH
	< SWITCH:
	< #else
	174d158
	< #endif

That's all there was to do. Not that much, is it?


2) A SMALL BUG AND SOME INCONSISTENCIES

2.1) filesys/filesys.cc: line 132-135

	The lines

		delete freeMap; 
		delete directory; 
		delete mapHdr; 
		delete dirHdr;

	are included in a debug if-statement. They should be out of
	there.


2.2) filesys/Makefile: line 11

	If doing the assignments in your proposed order, the DEFINES
	should be 

	  DEFINES = -DUSER_PROGRAM -DFILESYS_NEEDED -DFILESYS -DVM -DUSE_TLB

	instead of

	  DEFINES =-DTHREADS -DUSER_PROGRAM -DVM -DFILESYS_NEEDED -DFILESYS

	(In any case -DTHREADS must not be there.)


2.3) Assignment #4, exercise 4. mentiones a -DREALISM flag and a file
      called test4.cc, both of which I couldn't find.  test4.cc should
      probably be fstest.cc; I have no idea about the -DREALISM.
