Subject: New Nachos project extension

Dr. Anderson,

We recently used your Nachos project in our graduate OS class here at
UVa.  As part of our work this semester, we added an interesting new
feature to the system.  We have created what we call "Nachos/486": A
stand-alone version of the Nachos kernel.

Nachos/486 allows the same kernel that runs on the host operating
system as a process to be re-linked (not recompiled) and run
stand-alone on Intel hardware.  This stand-alone operating system runs
native in protected-mode utilizing some of the features of the Intel
x86 architecture.  Without swamping you in details of how we
implemented the system, we wanted to mention it to you and see if you
were interested in hearing more about it.

We think the work has some real potential in that it adds a whole new
and realistic dimension to the Nachos system: Simulating the
operating system, and then letting it loose on the hardware.  If you
are interested in reading more about it, there is a small web page
about it at "http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bah6f/nachos486/".  Available
from that page is the report that accompanied the project, which
contains summary information and some implementation details.

We look forward to hearing your thoughts on the project and its
potential.

Adrian Filipi-Martin
