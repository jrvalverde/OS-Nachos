I ftp'ed nachos3.2.tar from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.
The cross directory contains the files ftp'ed from prep.ai.mit.edu
for generating the cross-compiler.

\section{Changes needed to port nachos 3.2 to linux on a PC}

All the changes are in nachos-3.2/code.

\item
Makefile.dep
a) Change HOST to -DHOST_i386 with commenting out

\item
Makefile.common
a) When the depend target runs, ed complains about its input file.
Cause a ``q'' to be added to ed's input file
 by adding a line to
the depend target code in Makefile.common.

\item
threads/utility.cc
a) Comment out from #ifdef HOST_SNAKE through the stdarg.h lines.
Add a line #include <stdarg.h>.

\item
threads/switch.s
a) Deleted all but the HOST_i386 case because the assembler for some
reason was trying to assemble the HOST_MIPS code.

\item
machine/sysdep.cc
a) Conflicting types for creat() and open() so commented out their
declarations in machine/sysdep.cc
b) The fifth argument of the sendto() function that is 
called in
SendToSocket() has an argument conflict. The call type does not
match the declaration in /usr/include/sys/socket.h. So I recast the
argument in the call in SendToSocket to match the declaration.
c) NOTE: Compilation of the nachos networks directory currently fails
with an error that the sockets receivefrom() function is not being
used correctly.
d) Error saying that there is no getpagesize() function. I added at
the top of sysdep.cc a #include <unistd.h> which is where
getpagesize() is declared.
e
) In AllocBoundedArray() and DeallocBoundedArray() I commented out
calls to the mprotect() system call that I could not find on linux
(seems to be in /usr/include/linux/sys.h, but a #include of this
file did not solve the problem).
f) Commented out declarations at the top of sysdep.cc for unlink(),
read(), write(), and lseek() that were conflicting with slightly
different linux declarations.


\section{Steps for creating a cross-compiler for the i486-linux host
and mips target}

\item
Follow the cross-compi
ler directions in the README file in
nachos3.2.tar with the following corrections.
a) Don't use the gccLocal environment variable. Just type /usr/local
everywhere instead since linux does not make the substitution.

b) In the calls to the configure program the host name is i486-linux.

c) In the call to the ar program the command is ``ar rc libgcc.a
/dev/null''. The ``c'' flag is a modifier so an operation flag, the
``r'', also had to be specified.

d) Tom says to remove any dependency on cross-test and enq
uire in the
Makefile in the gcc* directory. What I did was commented out the line
``ENQUIRE = enquire'' and replaced it with ``ENQUIRE = '' and
commented out the line ``CROSS_TEST = cross-test'' and replaced it
with ``CROSS_TEST = ''.

e) The command ``make LANGUAGES=c'' in the gcc* directory stops on an
error in the sdbout.c file on line 57. The change I made was to change
that line 57 from #include <syms.h> to #include "gsyms.h" since the
/usr/include directory does not have a syms.h file, but there is a 

gsyms.h file in the current directory.

f) In code/test/Makefile change the path for GCCDIR when
cross-compiling to /usr/local/decstation-ultrix/bin/ which is where
the cross-compiler directions places the executables.

Tom,

the letter by Alan Cox I forwarded you yesterday 
said "a later 1.3.x kernel", not " a kernel 1.3.x or later".
Alan (who is responsible for the Linux networking support)
meant that the problem has been fixed in one of the latest
patches to the 1.3.x version of the kernel. Version 1.3 is
not a stable kernel release, but an experimental one, and
ther are at the moment forty patches or so.
I strongly advise to anyone working on a Linux system 
to postpone as far as possible the network assignment, and
to wait for the next stable kernel release (the forthcoming 1.4).

Cheers

Umberto
