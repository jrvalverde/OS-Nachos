Hello Nachos-Team!
I am trying to install Nachos V3.4 under linux on a PC.
After I have made the patches (which are described on your www-sides), I have still the following
problem:
to compile the file (maybe also the following) out.c in the /bin subtree, my gcc cannot
find the files <aouthdr.h>, <scnhdr.h>, <reloc.h>, <syms.h> which should be included by the
preprocessor.
Maybe you have an idea, what the problem is, and even better, you know a solution.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Sorry for the delay.  You don't need the disassembler on 
non-MIPS machines.  So just comment out that part of the makefile.
