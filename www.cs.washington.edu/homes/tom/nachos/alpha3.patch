Subject: Nachos v3.4 on DEC Alpha/OSF and i386/Linux systems
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Windows (v2.40)
Status: RO

Dear Prof. Anderson,
Your Nachos web page contains a link to the DEC Alpha OSF/1 patch
I made about two years ago (someone else's patch to work on alpha).
Shichi Oikawa indipendentely made a DEC Alpha OSF/1 patch for
Nachos v3.3 (?) (patch to work on alpha).
In the meanwhile, I made a Dec Alpha patch to the latest Nachos
release (v3.4). I successfully use it for courses on operating
systems design and implementation at the Computer Science Institute
of the University of Bologna, at Cesena, Italy.
Nachos v3.4 runs on DEC Alpha platforms with OSF/1 v2 and v3
operating systems and can be compiled with gcc v.2.7.2 and
binutils v.2.7. The same development tools can be used as
cross-compilation environment to produce MIPS executables that
safely run as user processes on top of Nachos.
With the DEC Alpha patch, I have enclosed a patch for the Linux
system (kernel v.1.2.x and higher, gcc/cross-gcc 2.7.2 and
binutils/cross-binutils 2.7). Assignments developed on Linux run
successfully when ported to OSF/1 and viceversa.
Both the patches are stable (I've had over 50 projects successfully
completed) so I would be happy if they could be applied to a new
official Nachos release.
The Dec Alpha (and Linux) patches are contained in the attached
file alpha34.gz. It is a context-diff file that can be applied to
Nachos v3.4 by using 'patch'.
The installation steps are the following:
$ uncompress nachos-3.4.tar.Z
$ tar xf nachos-3.4.tar 
$ gunzip alpha34.gz
$ patch < alpha34

Best regards,
